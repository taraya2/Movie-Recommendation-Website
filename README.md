## Data Engineering & ETL

Used official IMDb TSV datasets to build a clean and normalized movie dataset.

- Parsed and joined: `title.basics.tsv`, `title.ratings.tsv`, `title.principals.tsv`, `name.basics.tsv`
- Filtered for:
  - Movies only
  - Release years: 2000â€“2023
  - Valid ratings, directors, and cast
- Extracted structured columns: genres, directors, primary cast, and ratings
- Wrote a Java-based ETL process to:
  - Normalize and transform data into a clean CSV
  - Load data into PostgreSQL using Spring Boot and JPA with batch inserts for performance
